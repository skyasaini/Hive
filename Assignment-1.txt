a. Calculate total sales per year

select year_id as year , sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed

hive> select PRODUCTCODE ,sum(QUANTITYORDERED) as total_no_of_sales from sales_order_orc group by PRODUCTCODE  order by total_no_of_sales asc;
 
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter

hive> select QTR_ID, sum(SALES) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by QTR_ID order by total_sales asc;

d.In which quarter sales was minimum
