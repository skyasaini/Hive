Objective - The assignment is meant for you to apply learnings of the module on Hive on a real-life dataset. One of the major objectives of this assignment is gaining
            familiarity with how an analysis works in Hive and how you can gain insights from large datasets.
           
           
Problem Statement - New York City is a thriving metropolis and just like most other cities of similar size, one of the biggest
                    problems its residents face is parking. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and a cramped geography is the exact
                    recipe that leads to a large number of parking tickets.
                  
In an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department regularly collects data related to parking 
tickets. This data is made available by NYC Open Data portal. We will try and perform some analysis on this data.

Note: Consider only the year 2017 for analysis and not the Fiscal year.

The analysis can be divided into two parts:

Part-I: Examine the data

1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.

            select count(distinct summons_number) No_of_Tickets  from parking_violations_2017 ;
            ans : 204038
         
2.) Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.
           select count(distinct Registration_State) as Registration_states from parking_violations_2017;
           ans 63.
           
3.) Some parking tickets donâ€™t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are 
    (i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
            select count(distinct summons_number) as Tickets_without_address from parking_violations_2017 where Street_code1 = 0 or Street_code2 = 0 or Street_code3 = 0;
            ans : 68256
            
            
Part-II: Aggregation tasks

1.) How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)
            Hive> select count(Violation_Code) as violation_codes_frequency,Violation_Code from parking_violations_2017 group by Violation_Code order by violation_codes_frequency desc limit 5;
            
            
2.) How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)
            Hive> select Vehicle_Body_Type,count(summons_number)as Vehicle_body_frequency  from parking_violations_2017 group by Vehicle_Body_Type order by                         Vehicle_body_frequency desc limit 5; 
            
            Hive> select Vehicle_make,count(summons_number)as vehicle_make_frequency from parking_violations_2017 group by Vehicle_make order by                                                vehicle_make_frequency desc limit 5; 
            
3.) A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
      a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)
                        hive> select Violation_Precinct ,count(Violation_Precinct) as violation_precinct_frequency from parking_violations_2017 group by                                        Violation_Precinct order by violation_precinct_frequency desc limit 5;
      
      b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)
            hive> select issuer_Precinct ,count(issuer_Precinct) as issuer_precinct_frequency from parking_violations_2017 group by  issuer_Precinct order by                                   issuer_precinct_frequency desc limit 5;
            
4.) Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - do these precinct zones have an exceptionally 
    high frequency of certain violation codes?
            Hive> select Issuer_Precinct,Violation_Code, count(*) as Violation_code_frequency from parking_violations_2017  group by Issuer_Precinct, Violation_Code                            order by Violation_code_frequency desc limit 10;
    18,19,14 are the three issuer precincts which have the maximum number of violations. Lets dive into the Issuer Precincts one by one.
    
            Issuer Precinct 18
                        Hive> select Issuer_Precinct,Violation_Code, count(*) as Violation_code_frequency from parking_violations_2017 where issuer_precinct = 18                                     group by Issuer_Precinct, Violation_Code order by Violation_code_frequency desc limit 10;
                        
            Issuer Precinct 19
                        Hive> select Issuer_Precinct,Violation_Code, count(*) as Violation_code_frequency from parking_violations_2017 where issuer_precinct = 19                                     group by Issuer_Precinct, Violation_Code order by Violation_code_frequency desc limit 10;
                        
            Issuer Precinct 14
                        hive>select Issuer_Precinct,Violation_Code, count(*) as Violation_code_frequency from parking_violations_2017 where issuer_precinct = 14  group                              by Issuer_Precinct, Violation_Code order by Violation_code_frequency desc limit 10;

            
5.) Find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day: The Violation Time field is specified in a strange format. 
    Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.
            Hive> select from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(violation_time,'M'), 'HHmmaaa'),"HH:mmaaa") as date_data from parking_violations_2017 limit 2;
    
6.) Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, 
    find the 3 most commonly occurring violations
            To divide the 24 hrs into 6 equal discrete bins of time , First created view on partitioned table:
                        hive> create view vw_parking_violations_partitoned_2017
                                    partitioned on (Violation_Code) 
                                    as 
                                    SELECT 
                                    Summons_Number,
                                    Violation_Time,
                                    Issuer_Precinct, 
                                    case

7.) Now, try another direction. For the 3 most commonly occurring violation codes, find the most common times of day 
    (in terms of the bins from the previous part)
            Hive>  select Violation_Time_bin, count(*) frequency_times from vw_parking_violations_partitoned_2017 where Violation_Code in (21, 38,36) 
                   group by Violation_Time_bin order by frequency_times desc limit 3;

8.) Letâ€™s try and find some seasonality in this data
      a.) First, divide the year into some number of seasons, and find frequencies of tickets for each season. 
          (Hint: A quick Google search reveals the following seasons in NYC: Spring(March, April, March); Summer(June, July, August); Fall(September, October,                    November); Winter(December, January, February))
      b.)Then, find the 3 most common violations for each of these seasons.
