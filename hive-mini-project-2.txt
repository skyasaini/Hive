Objective - The assignment is meant for you to apply learnings of the module on Hive on a real-life dataset. One of the major objectives of this assignment is gaining
            familiarity with how an analysis works in Hive and how you can gain insights from large datasets.
           
           
Problem Statement - New York City is a thriving metropolis and just like most other cities of similar size, one of the biggest
                    problems its residents face is parking. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and a cramped geography is the exact
                    recipe that leads to a large number of parking tickets.
                  
In an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department regularly collects data related to parking 
tickets. This data is made available by NYC Open Data portal. We will try and perform some analysis on this data.

Note: Consider only the year 2017 for analysis and not the Fiscal year.

The analysis can be divided into two parts:

Part-I: Examine the data

1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.
2.) Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.
3.) Some parking tickets donâ€™t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are 
    (i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
